        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Eugene!</p>
        <p>I wrote a guide to playing panduri back when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in the beautiful country of Georgia. I had wanted to learn how to play panduri, but I was unable to find many resources online, and so after I had a chance to learn from some amazing teachers all over Georgia, I decided to make my own resources for people to be able to learn from.</p>
        <p>When I wrote the guide, my intended audience was other Peace Corps volunteers in Georgia who wanted to learn how to play panduri. However, when I started making videos, I realized that there was a lot of interest from people who weren't involved in Peace Corps.</p>
        <p>I decided to make my guide more accessible by putting it in website form. I will also include the original PDF link here.</p>
        <p>My intention for this website is to reach more people who want to learn how to play panduri. I also hope this website becomes a community for panduri players to discuss panduri-related issues and share tips for learning how to play.</p>
        <p>I wrote the words below back when I first wrote the guide, but they are still true, so I will keep them as is: </p>
        <p>I decided to write this guide because I love music and want more people to know about Georgian traditional music. I was interested in music prior to my Peace Corps service, so when I found out about the rich musical culture in this country, I jumped on the opportunity to learn as much as I could and, in turn, to teach as many people as I could. I hope this guide makes it easier for you to learn how to play the beautiful music of this amazing country.</p>
        <p>I'm not a music theory expert, so some information may not be academically correct, but I hope it will be helpful regardless.</p>
        <p>I am also not an expert in Georgian folk music. All of this information I have learned or assumed from personal experience.</p>
        <p>---</p>
